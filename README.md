# text-speech-translator
this program written in python will convert voice input in one language(english) to voice output in another language(hindi) and it can do vice-versa by just changing two lines mentioned inside the source code.
to start, just download the text-speech-ipynb file and run in either IDE(Jupyter,google collab, spyder,etc).
run all cells. It will install some necessary packages at first.
A text output will come...saying "say hello to initiate"
after that say your desired sentence
boom!!! An audio player will give out the same sentence in hindi
